# Assembler and Disassembler

## About this project

This project proposes the usage of an assembler and disassembler through a web-based approach, rather than the traditional app based approach. The platform focuses on the RISC-V architecture, known for its simplicity and modular design. It is intended to simplify the analysis and intricacies of assembly and machine code by being able to present it in a much more accessible and human-readable format. Unlike traditional static tools that simply translate code, this platform aims to provide a more comprehensive and flexible experience using real-time data conversion and AI powered assistance using the OpenAI API.
